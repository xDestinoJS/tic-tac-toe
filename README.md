Like everyone else so far that has joined the challenge up till now, their code is messy. And mine is no exception!

In my version, you can
 - play against another person (on the same computer)
 - play against another person (online) ...thanks socket.io!

I could do the AI but too lazy tbh _buuuuuuuuuuuuut_ I might do it before the deadline.

Oh yeah and, I called it tic tak toe on purpose because the site that I was coding on already had tictactoe taken as a project name

**If you wanna play online mode in literal milliseconds just go [here](https://tictaktoe.glitch.me/) and click Online, and send the link to your friend (for example https://tictaktoe.glitch.me/online/f81839ba-5509-4136-ba31-bb96f9e40c2f). When your friend opens the link, you will be put into a game!**
